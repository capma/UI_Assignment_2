# UI_Assignment_2
Assignment No. 2 will ask you to create a responsive web page that functions as a web usability design tutorial. Your site is meant for teaching the content from the books “Don't Make Me Think, Revisited: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability” and “Rocket surgery made easy: the do-it-yourself guide to finding and fixing usability problems.” Consider the assignment to be an interactive book review. Your target audience: An undergrad studying website development.     You need to read the two books (available from the Conestoga library as eBooks) and summarize all the main points. Then, using what you have learned about web usability from class lectures and the first book, create an interactive tutorial for a user to learn about web usability and user testing. Be creative!
